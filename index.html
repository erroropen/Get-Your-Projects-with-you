                    <b class="text-warning">naruto</b>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.<b class="text-warning"> </b> It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young
                    ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is
                    told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes
                    28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable
                    mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
                    
                    Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with
                    its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American production and serialized
                    Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by
                    Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series, which
                    adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran<b class="text-warning"></b> on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from
                    February 2007 to March 2017. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). The
                    franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. The story of Naruto
                    continues in Boruto, where Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja way instead of following his father's.</p>

                        A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha,<b class="text-warning"> the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five</b>
                        Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at
                        the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the
                        beast.[i] The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by
                        Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of
                        these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals
                        the truth to him. Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.[ii]
                        
                        Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura
                        Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all
                        the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers,<b class="text-warning"> ranging from doing chores</b> and
                        being bodyguards to performing assassinations.
